Experimenting and utilising the publicly available Titanic dataset using Python. Following a similar structure to the Python Data Analysis and Visualisation Udemy course but I have added new visualisations and data manipulations etc. Mainly using the Pandas library for manipulating and analysing the data into Series and DataFrames. In addition, I have used the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for the data visualisations and the sklearn library is used for the various machine learning algorithms executed on the dataset. The dataset has both a training and testing set.
